But it seems that, more often than not, everything that can go wrong, does goes wrong. Is it bad luck? Are you cursed with recieving terrible customer service? The truth is, the quality of a customer service experience all depends on the represenative. Sure, you're the one making the call, but their attitude guides the entire tone. This lesson serves as a guide to learn the first steps of providing quality customer service. </p>

                	<h2>The Basic Steps</h2>
                    <p class="notefont">So what are the best characteristics a representative can have? Think about your personal experiences with customer service. In those situations, how would you like the helper to act?</p>
                    <p class="notefont">First, a customer service attendant must be <strong>patient</strong>. Many times, a customer is calling because he or she is frustrated with a product or is struggling to fix something. Chances are they might not be in the best of moods, so how do you keep your cool? A good trick is to let the customer talk. Don’t ignore them, but let them vent. Once they see that you are there to help, and behaving in a professional manner, they will calm down.</p>
                    <p class="notefont">Another good idea is to practice <strong>positive body language</strong>. Whether you are sitting at a desk on a telephone or meeting face to face with a customer, make an effort to sit up straight and smile. Positive attitude is infectious and can help set the tone of the experience. If you are <strong>attentive</strong> to the customer, they will be more cooperative and open to discussion.  Also, the more you practice these positive skills, the easier it will be to handle customers, and the better you will be.</p>
                    <p class="notefont">Need an example? Watch the following video to see an example of how a representative correctly and incorrectly handles a customer:</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

        <div class="container">
			<div class="row spacemar notepad">
                    <div class="col-md-12 embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
                        <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t33k7VqgEOw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12 notepad">                
                    <p class="notefont">As seen in the second example, staying calm and positive allowed the conversation to flow. The representative was able to get more details about the problem and troubleshoot a solution. Note that in the first video, the representative did not <strong>accept the responsibility</strong> of the situation. Making these comments results in making the customer feel as if their problem is unimportant and only escalates the negativity. To avoid this, use polite language, and stay away from accusatory tones. For instance, instead of saying, “You don’t understand” consider using, “Let me clarify”.
