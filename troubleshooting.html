Although these are all very different problems learning how to troubleshoot can help you figure out a specific solution. The key is to ask a series of questions to act as a guide as to how you should approach the situation. Once you have more practice, you will know how to break down any seemingly difficult problem

                    <h2>The Basic Steps</h2>
                    <p class="notefont">The first step is to back up your data. Before you go do anything else, make sure that all of your information is copied and stored in an alternate location than the workspace you will be troubleshooting in. This is vital because if anything happens in the middle of testing you theory, your information could be lost. So, always back up your data.</p>
                    <p class="notefont">The second step is to review what you know. If it helps, write these notes on paper to sort your thoughts. By listing your observations (ex. the audio stopped playing, the iTunes program exited, I can no longer see the volume icon on the taskbar) you are stating the clear facts. By starting with what you know is true, it helps your mind start to build a solid theory</p>
                    <p class="notefont">The third step is to ask questions and start to guess the problem. Once you have your facts, a lot of questions will start to pop up. (Why is the taskbar no longer displaying the volume icon when the others are? Why does this only happen when I start the computer?) Then you will be able to take a guess as to why something is not working (It is possible that the icon is not being loaded).</p>
                    <p class="notefont">The fourth step is to test your theory.  If your test fails, then you must go back and continue testing different theories. This might involve research because while you might have a guess, you might not know how to execute your test. This is perfectly fine, and feel free to ask other people in person or search online about instructions. Chances are, someone else has already experienced the same problem and might have a few solutions. Test, check, and re-test.</p>
                    <p class="notefont">Once you finally resolved the issue, the following steps will help you finish the situation. Verify that the system works and everything is working as it should again. Then, ask yourself if the problem can be prevented, and, if so, take action. Finally, document your experience so that you have a record for future use. By following through with these steps, you are being proactive and are possibly making the entire process easier for you in the future.</p>
